- 👋 Hi, I’m @SuperSaiyancoderxx
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much as I can in the world of developing! I'm into working out, video games, anime, cars&trucks, and much more, but those are my building blocks : )
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS with the Head First HTML and CSS book. It's going very well so far. I'm 2 weeks in and currently learning more about CSS. Loving it so far!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really! Anything I can do to learn more, or if I can help with the limited knowledge I have, I'm more than happy to help!
- 📫 How to reach me. Twitter: @BugattiWilson that will be the best way to reach me.
